# restaurant-page

This is a project depicting a restaurant page using webpack.

It's going to generate the whole website with the bundling capabilities of webpack, all in one javascript file.

I know many websites use webpack so I thought I'd learn it. I figured it'd also be good for developing my skills with node package manager.
